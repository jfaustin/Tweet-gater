   Framework still apply.
   
*  While not required, we would prefer that you state where the code used to create

Installation

*  Extract the download into a web accessible directory on your webserver

*  Bring up your web browser and go to http://[wherever-you-installed-this-at]/install
   
*  The install script will take you the rest of the way through.
   
*  3 main pages are provied
   - index.php:  Shows all the tweets for the account you setup
   - orgs.php:   Shows all the accounts you are following
   - feed.php:   Provides an RSS feed of all the tweets for the account you setup
   

Known Issues

*  On some systems running PHP 5.3+ there seems to be a delay on writing information to the 
   config.php file.  The information will get written on the first request, but the installer
   sometimes does not recognize this.  It typically takes 3-5 seconds to it to realize the
   necessary actions have been taken.  A simple refresh of the installer page will make the 
   installer kick in.
